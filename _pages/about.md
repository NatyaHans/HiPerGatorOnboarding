[HiPerGator](https://www.rc.ufl.edu/about/hipergator/) is University of Florida's supercomputer. It is a cluster that has 
latest generation of processors offering several nodes for memory-intensive computation.

Smathers Libraries](https://uflib.ufl.edu/) and [UF Research Computing](https://www.rc.ufl.edu/) have partnered to provide HiPerGator and HiPerGator-RV (formerly ResVault) access to students who do not have funding for such access.
